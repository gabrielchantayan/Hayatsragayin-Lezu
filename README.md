## or, the Armenian Programming Language

This is an attempt to create a programming language based on the grammatical structure of Armenian.

---

## Why
Inspired by [https://github.com/kip-dili/kip](kip), I wanted to take a stab at what a programming 
language would look like if it were created according to the grammatical structure of my own native 
language. 

For myself, this is a test of system engineering. How well can I design a frankly novel programming 
language? Can I make it practical to write? Can I develop *functional* programs with it?

Here is an example of the code, written in Armenian script and Romanized script:

```
գլխավորել,
    «բարև աշհահր» ասեք։
վերջ։

գլխավորիր։    
```

```
// Main function
// From "glxavor" (main) + "el" (verb stem)
glxavorel,

  // "String" + aseq (say!)
  "barev ashharh" aseq.

// Function call
// Conjugating the function verb "glxavorel", replacing "el" with "ir"
// to place the verb in the imperative form
glxavorir.
```
